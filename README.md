# TheCup

The Cup is a half-finished game that plays a knock-out style football tournament.

It was created to get hands-on with cloud services rather than to create a good game, or to create a sensible development.
Not finished and I think it was due to a Functionapp only working in test on the local desktop ,but not once deployed to Azure. Logging wasn't helping so eventually gave up as I realised that I was no longer doing the things I needed to learn.
